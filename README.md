# Automated-Machine-Learning-Application


To automate end to end machine learning process.
----------------------------------------------

Automated Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AutoAI / AutoML) can now automate every step of the end-to-end AI Lifecycle, from data cleaning, to algorithm selection, and to model deployment and monitoring in the machine learning workflow. AutoAI technologies, initially aimed to save data scientists from the low level coding tasks, also has great potential to serve non-technical users such as domain experts and business users to build and deploy machine learning models. Researchers coined it as "democratizing AI", where non-technical users are empowered by AutoAI technologies to create and adopt AI models. To realize such promise, AutoAI needs to translate and incorporate the real-world business logic and requirements into the automation.
